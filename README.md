# data-sample
## 💻 **Project Name:** Data Sample Web App 📊✨

---

## 🌟 **Purpose of the Web App:**
This app helps you 📥 **upload Excel data**, 📑 **view the data**, 🧮 **analyze the data** (like average, minimum, maximum), and 📈 **visualize the data** using graphs — all on a web page created by **Streamlit**.

---

## 🛠 **Steps I Followed to Create This App:**

---

### 1️⃣ **I created a project folder 📂**
- Named it: `d-s.py`
- Inside it, I added:
  - `d-s.py` — My Streamlit Python file 🐍
  - `requirements.txt` — For library dependencies
  - `data_sample.xlsx` — Sample Excel data file (optional)

---

### 2️⃣ **I set up a Virtual Environment 🐍**
- To keep my project clean and separate:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3️⃣ **I installed important libraries 📚**
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas openpyxl matplotlib seaborn
```
- I added these to `requirements.txt` ✅

---

### 4️⃣ **I wrote the main Streamlit App code 🖥️**
- My app:
  - Shows a Title with Emojis 🎉
  - Has a file uploader to upload Excel data 📥
  - Displays uploaded data in table form 📝
  - Gives a data summary (mean, count, etc.) 📊
  - Creates beautiful charts and graphs 📈
  - Shows a secret message: **"Created by Ammara ❤️"**

---

### 5️⃣ **I ran my Streamlit App 🚀**
```bash
streamlit run d-s.py
```
✅ It opened automatically in my browser 🌐

---

### 6️⃣ **Key Features I Added ✨**
✔ Upload Excel file  
✔ View Data Table 🗒  
✔ Show Statistics (average, min, max) 📈  
✔ Data Visualization with Charts 📊  
✔ Hidden Message: _"Created by Ammara ❤️"_ 🔒

---

### 7️⃣ **I can Deploy this App Online 🌍**
- On **Replit**
- **Streamlit Cloud**
- **PythonAnywhere**

- ## 🎉 **Your Data Sample Web App is ready!**
